      <p>Hi! Thanks for visiting my page! :)</p> 
        <p>My name is Brittany Cordova, and I'm an aspiring web developer. This page is to showcase my projects and skills. I had a curiosity to HTML and CSS when I was 13 y/o thanks to myspace. I never really understood what I was doing when I played around with it on my page, but it did inspire me to make a fan website when I was in high school about my favorite video game at the time "Tales Of Symphonia". Where I displayed Fan-Art, Fan-Fiction, Trivia, and anything fan-related. 
          After I turned 16 however, I got a job at my local grocery store where they demanded a lot of my free time. I eventually stopped pursuing any more knowledge about web development or web design as I started getting promotions at my job which made them demand even more of my time. Now I'm 27 and I finally feel like I should just go for what I always wanted, which is designing and making professional websites and applications. I'm still a beginner, and I have so much to learn still.
          Please feel free to contact me and look at my projects on this site and let me know what you think so far!</p>
         
        <p>Thanks for your time!</p>
